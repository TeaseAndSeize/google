Google Terms of ServiceEffective May 22, 2024 | Archived versions | Download PDFCountry version: IrelandWhat’s covered in these termsWe know it’s tempting to skip these Terms of Service, but it’s important to establish what you can expect from us as you use Google services, and what we expect from you.These Terms of Service reflect the way Google’s business works, the laws that apply to our company, and certain things we’ve always believed to be true. As a result, these Terms of Service help define Google’s relationship with you as you interact with our services. For example, these terms include the following topic headings:What you can expect from us, which describes how we provide and develop our servicesWhat we expect from you, which establishes certain rules for using our servicesContent in Google services, which describes the intellectual property rights to the content you find in our services — whether that content belongs to you, Google, or othersIn case of problems or disagreements, which describes other legal rights you have, and what to expect in case someone violates these termsUnderstanding these terms is important because, to use our services, you must accept these terms. We encourage you to download these terms for future reference. We make these terms, and all previous versions, available at all times here.Besides these terms, we also publish a Privacy Policy. Although it’s not part of these terms, we encourage you to read it to better understand how you can update, manage, export, and delete your information.TermsService providerIn the European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland, Google services are provided by, and you’re contracting with:Google Ireland Limitedincorporated and operating under the laws of Ireland(Registration Number: 368047 / VAT Number: IE6388047V)Gordon House, Barrow StreetDublin 4IrelandAge requirementsIf you’re under the age required to manage your own Google Account, you must have your parent or legal guardian’s permission to use a Google Account.

When we speak of “Google,” “we,” “us,” and “our,” we mean Google Ireland Limited and its affiliates. Broadly speaking, we give you permission to access and use our services if you agree to follow these terms, which reflect how Google’s business works and how we earn money.What you can expect from usProvide a broad range of useful servicesWe provide a broad range of services that are subject to these terms, including:apps and sites (like Search and Maps)platforms (like Google Shopping)integrated services (like Maps embedded in other companies’ apps or sites)devices (like Google Nest and Pixel)Many of these services also include content that you can stream or interact with.Our services are designed to work together, making it easier for you to move from one activity to the next. For example, if your Calendar event includes an address, you can click on that address and Maps can show you how to get there.Develop, improve, and update Google servicesWhile we use a broad definition of “services” throughout these terms as described above, applicable law draws distinctions between “digital content”, “services”, and “goods” in certain situations. That’s why we use the more specific terms in this section and the Legal guarantee section.We’re constantly developing new technologies and features to improve our services. For example, we use artificial intelligence and machine learning to provide you with simultaneous translations, and to better detect and block spam and malware.As part of the continual evolution of our digital content, services, and goods, we make modifications such as adding or removing features and functionalities, increasing or decreasing usage limits, and offering new digital content or services or discontinuing old ones. We may also change our digital content or services for these other reasons:to adapt to new technologiesto reflect increases or decreases in the number of people who use a particular serviceto respond to key changes in the licenses and partnerships we have with othersto prevent abuse or harmto address legal, regulatory, safety, or security issuesIn particular, we sometimes make legally-required updates, which are modifications that keep digital content, services, or goods in conformity with the law. We make these updates to our digital content, services, and goods for safety or security reasons, and to make sure they meet the quality standards that you expect, such as those described in the Legal guarantee section. We may automatically install updates that address significant safety or security risks. For other updates, you can choose whether you want them installed.We maintain a rigorous product research program, so before we change or stop offering a service, we carefully consider your interests as a user, your reasonable expectations, and the potential impact on you and others. We only change or stop offering services for valid reasons.If a modification negatively affects your ability to access or use our digital content or services, or if we stop offering a service all together, we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice by email — including a description of the changes, when they’ll take place, and your right to end your contract with us if our modifications create more than a minor negative impact — except in urgent situations such as preventing abuse or harm, responding to legal requirements, or addressing security and operability issues. We’ll also provide you with an opportunity to export your content from your Google Account using Google Takeout, subject to applicable law and policies.What we expect from youFollow these terms and service-specific additional termsThe permission we give you to access and use our services continues as long as you comply with:these termsservice-specific additional terms, which could, for example, include things like additional age requirementsWe also make various policies, help centers, and other resources available to you to answer common questions and to set expectations about using our services. These resources include our Privacy Policy, Copyright Help Center, Safety Center, Transparency Center, and other pages accessible from our policies site. Finally, we may provide specific instructions and warnings within our services – such as dialog boxes that alert you to important information.Although we give you permission to use our services, we retain any intellectual property rights we have in the services.Respect othersWe want to maintain a respectful environment for everyone, which means you must follow these basic rules of conduct:comply with applicable laws, including export control, sanctions, and human trafficking lawsrespect the rights of others, including privacy and intellectual property rightsdon’t abuse or harm others or yourself (or threaten or encourage such abuse or harm) — for example, by misleading, defrauding, illegally impersonating, defaming, bullying, harassing, or stalking othersOur service-specific additional terms and policies, such as our Generative AI Prohibited Use Policy, provide additional details about appropriate conduct that everyone using those services must follow. If you find that others aren’t following these rules, many of our services allow you to report abuse. If we act on a report of abuse, we also provide the process described in the Taking action in case of problems section.Don’t abuse our servicesMost people who access or use our services understand the general rules that keep the internet safe and open. Unfortunately, a small number of people don’t respect those rules, so we’re describing them here to protect our services and users from abuse. In that spirit:You must not abuse, harm, interfere with, or disrupt our services or systems — for example, by:introducing malwarespamming, hacking, or bypassing our systems or protective measuresjailbreaking, adversarial prompting, or prompt injection, except as part of our safety and bug testing programsaccessing or using our services or content in fraudulent or deceptive ways, such as:phishingcreating fake accounts or content, including fake reviewsmisleading others into thinking that generative AI content was created by a humanproviding services that appear to originate from you (or someone else) when they actually originate from usproviding services that appear to originate from us when they do notusing our services (including the content they provide) to violate anyone’s legal rights, such as intellectual property or privacy rightsreverse engineering our services or underlying technology, such as our machine learning models, to extract trade secrets or other proprietary information, except as allowed by applicable lawusing automated means to access content from any of our services in violation of the machine-readable instructions on our web pages (for example, robots.txt files that disallow crawling, training, or other activities)using AI-generated content from our services to develop machine learning models or related AI technologyhiding or misrepresenting who you are in order to violate these termsproviding services that encourage others to violate these termsPermission to use your contentSome of our services are designed to let you upload, submit, store, send, receive, or share your content.

If you choose to upload or share content, please make sure you have the necessary rights to do so and that the content is lawful.LicenseYour content remains yours, which means that you retain any intellectual property rights that you have in your content.

Or you may have the right to share someone else’s creative content if they’ve given you their permission.We need your permission if your intellectual property rights restrict our use of your content. You provide Google with that permission through this license.What’s coveredThis license covers your content if that content is protected by intellectual property rights.What’s not coveredThis license doesn’t affect your data protection rights — it’s only about your intellectual property rightsThis license doesn’t cover these types of content:publicly-available factual information that you provide, such as corrections to the address of a local business.

For example, if you shared a photo with a friend who then made a copy of it, or shared it again, then that photo may continue to appear in your friend’s Google Account even after you remove it from your Google Account.If you make your content available through other companies’ services, it’s possible that search engines, including Google Search, will continue to find and display your content as part of their search results.Using Google servicesYour Google AccountIf you meet these age requirements you can create a Google Account for your convenience. Some services require that you have a Google Account in order to work — for example, to use Gmail, you need a Google Account so that you have a place to send and receive your email.You’re responsible for what you do with your Google Account, including taking reasonable steps to keep your Google Account secure, and we encourage you to regularly use the Security Checkup.Using Google services on behalf of an organization or businessMany organizations, such as businesses, non-profits, and schools, take advantage of our services.

They don’t create any legal rights for other people or organizations, even if others benefit from that relationship under these terms.We want to make these terms easy to understand, so we’ve used examples from our services. But not all services mentioned may be available in your country.If it turns out that a particular term is not valid or enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.If you don’t follow these terms or the service-specific additional terms, and we don’t take action right away, that doesn’t mean we’re giving up any rights that we may have, such as taking action in the future.We may update these terms and service-specific additional terms (1) to reflect changes in our services or how we do business — for example, when we add new services, features, technologies, pricing, or benefits (or remove old ones), (2) for legal, regulatory, or security reasons, or (3) to prevent abuse or harm.If we materially change these terms or service-specific additional terms, we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice and the opportunity to review the changes, except (1) when we launch a new service or feature, or (2) in urgent situations, such as preventing ongoing abuse or responding to legal requirements.
